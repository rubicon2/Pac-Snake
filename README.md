# Pac-Snake
https://rubicon2.github.io/Pac-Snake/

Snake clone with some 100% totally crazy and original new features. 

Started and mostly finished in February 2020 with not much in the way of Javascript/HTML/CSS experience, using only what I had learned at that time. Went back in 2022 and fixed a few bugs and added a scoreboard after each round, after some friends threatened to play it again. 

Snake controls:
- Pink: Arrow keys
- Blue: WASD
- Red: IJKL
- Green: 8456 (Numpad)
